Calendar Generator
The suj.java program is designed to generate a basic calendar for the month of January 2024. It displays the days of the month in a grid format, with each column representing a day of the week (Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa, Su) and each row representing a week. The program fills in the grid with numbers starting from 1, incrementing consecutively until the end of the month.

Features
Customizable Output: The program outputs a calendar for January 2024. However, with minor adjustments, it can be modified to generate calendars for other months and years.
Grid Layout: The calendar is presented in a grid layout, making it easy to visualize the days of the month and their corresponding weekdays.

Usage
To use this program, simply compile suj.java and run the compiled class file. The program will output the calendar for January 2024 to the console.

Limitations
Specific to January 2024: The current implementation is hardcoded for January 2024 and does not handle different month lengths or starting days of the week for other months.

Future Improvements
To make this program more versatile, it could be enhanced to accept input for the desired month and year, dynamically calculate the starting day of the week for the given month, and adjust the grid layout accordingly.
